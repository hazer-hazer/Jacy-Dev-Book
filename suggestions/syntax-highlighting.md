# Syntax Highlighting

Currently, this feature is not implemented, anyway here I'm going to describe how it works.
The idea is to highlight _Jacy_ code in terminal output.
<div class="nav-btn-block">
    <button class="nav-btn left">
    <a class="link" href="/Jacy-Dev-Book/suggestions/structure.md">< Structure</a>
</button>

    
</div>
