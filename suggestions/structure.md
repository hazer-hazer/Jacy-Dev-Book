# Suggestions structure

Here, I'm going to describe what kinds of suggestions (should) exist and how they are structured.

## Suggestions update

Currently (29.09.2021), suggestion system is pretty powerful for WIP language, however not that ideal and extensible -- all suggestions are structured in the same way, and the only additional feature is the "hint" messages support.

What I want:

- Header message, i.e. the actual "error/warning" message, the most essential part
- Span highlighting styles
<div class="nav-btn-block">
    <button class="nav-btn left">
    <a class="link" href="/Jacy-Dev-Book/suggestions/index.html">< Suggestions</a>
</button>

    <button class="nav-btn right">
    <a class="link" href="/Jacy-Dev-Book/suggestions/syntax-highlighting.html">Syntax highlighting ></a>
</button>

</div>
