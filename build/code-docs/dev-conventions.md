# Dev Conventions

This is a collection of code conventions, some of them are strict some not. In conventions, "MUST" really means that a
rule MUST be followed, "SHOULD" means that in most cases it is better to choose this rule than different "CAN (be)"
means that there's a preferred way to do something but it is either optional either often requires another approach.
