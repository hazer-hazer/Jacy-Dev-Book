# Particles

Instead of writing large paper containing things I (don't) want to see in _Jacy_, I want to describe a collection of features. These are kind of RFCs but particles are more specific and more about specific decisions that are not mostly discussed.

I want to keep a list of almost every particular decision I've made to make it possible in the future to assemble the full picture of what _Jacy_ became.
