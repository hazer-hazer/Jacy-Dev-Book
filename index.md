# Jacy DevBook

## What is DevBook

This is not documentation, not a specification, and even not a user guide or dev guide.
This is a kind of notebook where I write as much as I can about _Jacy_. You can think of it as a collection of everything described above but at the WIP stage. You can find some development documentation but it is not exhaustive, same for user guides and RFCs.

## How to use DevBook

If you are interested in the _Jacy_ compiler and how it works you can find an abstract description for almost every stage in the [compiler workflow](compiler-workflow/index.md), which includes information about the important parts of the compiler, i.e. there's no information about logging, suggestions, etc. but about IRs and the main logic.
