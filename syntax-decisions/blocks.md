# Blocks



Before the control-flow chapter, I have to establish rules about blocks, which are different from Rust's. All blocks \(in control-flow\) which enclosed into `{}` are last-statement typed \(it means that the last expression of this block is the value and type of the whole block\).

While Rust has rules about the absence of `;`, _Jacy_ does not have required `;`, so this rule cannot be applied in the same way. Let's look at some examples:

* This block is of type `bool` and has result value `true`, even though

  we don't use this value

```text
{true}
```

* This block will produce a type error because it either has a result of

  type of `myval` or `()` \(unit type\)

```text
let a = {if myval => myval}
```

* This block won't produce a type error, because we don't use the result

  value

```text
{if myval => myval}
```

So, we already can establish some requirements about type analysis -- we need union types which are impossible to be declared in language, but may exist in the type system.

**One-line blocks**

In this thing, _Jacy_ blocks differ from Rust's. I really appreciate the opportunity to declare one-line blocks without `{}`. As far as I wanna _Jacy_ to be consistent, and I established that syntax of `match` expression arms use `=>`, for one-line blocks we use the same syntax. Let's look at the syntax:

```text
while true => print('kek')
```

After `=>` we can only place one expression, and if we put `{}` compiler will give a warning because there's no need to put `{}` after `=>`. So, the syntax looks kind of like that:

```text
block: `=>` expr | blockExpression | ';';
```

`{}` blocks in control-flow behave absolutely the same way as block-expressions.

One important thing is that function declaration has different syntax and rules about blocks, more about that soon below.

**Ignoring blocks**

This is a feature that satisfies one definite rule from Zen -- prototyping ease. It is a pretty simple thing -- we can ignore any block \(including control-structures, `mod`s, `func`s, etc.\) with `;`.

Examples:

```text
if myval;
else doSomething()
```

Of course, I couldn't leave this thing without covering the Zen rule about helping a user with mistakes, so there will be a warning if you're writing code like that.
