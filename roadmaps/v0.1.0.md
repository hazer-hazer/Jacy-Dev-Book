# v0.1.0 Plan

Okay, finally. I came up with too many feature ideas, and the problem is that, currently, the compiler handles too many features for WIP project, and large part of them not fully implemented. This is why I want to describe a list of required features for first alpha version. It may be extended or shrank but must contain only features required to make basic programs.

I'll try to reason appearance of each feature in this list.

At first, I'll describe a brief list, separating features by scopes.
Also, there will be features marked with <span class="label-highlight">backlog</span> label.

## Brief list

### Type System
<div class="nav-btn-block">
    <button class="nav-btn left">
    <a class="link" href="/Jacy-Dev-Book/roadmaps/index.html">< Roadmaps</a>
</button>

    
</div>
